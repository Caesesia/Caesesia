# 👋 Yo, I'm Caesesia

🎓 I'm a **Cybersecurity enthusiast** with a passion for **Blue Team** security. While I enjoy participating in **CTFs** and solving **web security** and **forensics challenges**, I’m much more interested in the defensive side of security.

🐧 I’m currently studying **Networking** and **Cybersecurity**, which include a focus on **network protocols**, **system administration**, and **securing networks and systems**.

What I’m into:
- 🛡️ **Blue Team Security** (network defense, incident response, system hardening)
- 💻 **System Administration** (managing and securing networks and systems)
- 🔍 **Forensics** (data recovery, analysis, and reverse engineering)
- 🎮 **CTFs** (mainly web and forensics challenges)
- 🐍 **Scripting (Python)**, with a growing interest in **DevOps** and **DevSecOps**
- 🐧 **Open-source** (notably Linux) and **user privacy**

I’m always looking to improve my skills and knowledge, especially in areas like **scripting**, **network security** and **pentesting**. I’m passionate about the open-source community, especially **Linux**, and work to ensure **user privacy** in all aspects of security.

🌱 I’m constantly exploring new tools, techniques, and best practices, and I’m always up for discussing defensive security or participating in new challenges!
