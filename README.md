# 👋 Hey, buddy

🎓 I'm a **Cybersecurity enthusiast** with an interest in **Blue Team** security. I enjoy participating in **CTFs** and solving **web security** and **forensics challenges** mainly, but I’m much more interested in the defensive side of security.

🐧 Currently studying **Networking** and **Cybersecurity**, with a focus on **network protocols**, **system administration**, and **securing networks and systems**.

A few things I’m into:
- 🛡️ **Blue Team Security** (network defense, incident response, system hardening)
- 💻 **System Administration** (managing and securing networks and systems)
- 🔍 **Forensics** (data recovery, analysis, and reverse engineering)
- 🎮 **CTFs and pentesting** (mainly web, forensics and network challenges)
- 🐍 **Scripting (Python, Shell)**, with a growing interest in **DevOps** and **DevSecOps**
- 🐧 **Open-source** (notably Linux) and **user privacy**

I’m always looking to improve my skills and knowledge, especially in areas like **scripting**, **network security** and **pentesting**. I’m passionate about the open-source community, especially the **Linux** project, and am committed to **privacy** in all aspects of security.
